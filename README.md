# NSMBU spritedata.xml
The latest information about sprites in New Super Mario Bros. U.

The previous system of collaborating via Google Docs was causing my browser to lag, so I've moved the project here. Everyone who has researched NSMBU sprite data before will get write access to this repository.

This spritedata.xml is technically part of the Reggie Next Level Editor, so this is therefore licensed under the GNU GPL v3.
